Nim -- Node.js Vim
------------------
What is Nim?
  A collaborative text editor written in node.js and inspired by vim.
  Nim is a pastie service, and collaborative text editor.

Features:
  - Asynchronous collaborative editing of a file, known as a "nimbus"
  - Users can create new nimbus sessions from a text file
  - Users can join existing nimbus sessions via special url:
      nim://mindynamics.com:8000/oPfDkasd
  - Web users can view/download a nimbus buffer in the browser:
      http://mindynamics.com:8000/oPfDkasd

Usage: 
  nim [<file> <host> <port> | <nimbus_url>]

Controls:
  i Input mode
  : Command mode
  :q Quit
  :w Save
  :x Save and quit
  ? Chat mode
  Esc Return to normal mode

TCP Protocol:
  Connection:
    Creating a new nimbus:
        If I am creating a nimbus for test.txt at localhost on port 8000,
      I will send a "create_new_nimbus" and wait until I receive a nimbus id
      "new_nimbus:oPfDkasd", upon which I will send my buffer for test.txt.
      When I am done sending my buffer, I will send "end_buffer:oPfDkasd".
      In the status bar, I display the nimbus url for sharing as:
        nim:localhost:8000/oPfDkasd

    Joining an existing nimbus:
        Now I am someone else, and I receive the above nimbus url, launching
      my copy of nim with it. I will connect to the host and port, and send
      and introductory message: "join_nimbus:oPfDkasd". The server will then
      send all the buffer data, ending with "synced_with_nimbus:oPfDkasd"
