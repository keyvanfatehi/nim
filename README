Nim -- Node.js Vim
------------------
What is Nim?
  An ncurses-based collaborative text editor written in C and inspired by vim.
  Nim functions as a pastie service for your terminal.
  The server also allows retrieving of files through http request.
  
Features:
  - Asynchronous collaborative editing of a file (a "nimbus")
  - Users can create a new nimbus session from a text file
  - Users can join existing nimbus sessions via nimbus id:
      ./nim oPfDkasd
  - Web users can view/download a nimbus buffer in the browser:
      http://nimb.us/oPfDkasd

Usage:
  nim <file_path> <-- Create a new nimbus from a file
  nim <nimbus_id> <-- Join an existing nimbus by id
  nim             <-- Create a blank nimbus

Controls:
  i Input mode
  : Command mode
  :q Quit
  :w Save
  :x Save and quit
  ? Chat mode
  Esc Return to normal mode
  
Dependencies:
  To use the client:
    none, as it is implemented in C with ncurses (which you likely already have)
  
  To run the server:
    node_redis: npm install redis
